(Draft) FAIR Federation Data Resource Guide on scheduled Hackathon, Workshop and Demonstration Events
============
This document is a living document that will drive the organisation of the series of EJP-RD Hackathons, Workshops and Demonstrations. It is a living document that will be updated as the project progresses. 

Hackathons, Workshops and Demonstrations are a key part of the EJP-RD project. They will be used to bring together the EJP-RD community to discuss and develop FAIR Data. They will also be used to demonstrate the use of FAIR Data Resources
and the FAIRification of data resources.
